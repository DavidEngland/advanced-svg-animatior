## Integration Code Examples

### Manual Logging
If you want to add custom logging to your own SVG-related code:

```php
// Check if Simple History integration is available
if (class_exists('ASA_Simple_History_Logger')) {
    
    // Log custom SVG event
    ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_svg_upload(
        $attachment_id,
        $filename,
        array(
            'size' => $file_size,
            'custom_field' => 'custom_value'
        )
    );
}
```

### Available Logger Methods

```php
// Plugin lifecycle
ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_plugin_status('activated');
ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_plugin_status('deactivated');

// SVG file operations
ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_svg_upload($attachment_id, $filename, $file_data);
ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_svg_deletion($attachment_id, $filename, $reason);
ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_svg_quarantine($attachment_id, $filename, $reason);

// Security scanning

ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_animation_block_usage($post_id, $animation_type, $block_data);

// Settings changes  
ASA_Simple_History_Logger::log_settings_change($old_settings, $new_settings);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Appearing

3. Ensure Advanced SVG Animator is properly activated

### Missing Log Details
1. Update to the latest version of both plugins
2. Check WordPress error logs for PHP errors
3. Verify the `ASA_Simple_History_Logger` class is loading properly

### Performance Considerations

1. Go to **Settings → Simple History**
2. Adjust log retention period (default: 60 days)
3. Configure user roles that can view logs
4. Set up email notifications for critical events

### Integration Settings
The SVG Animator automatically detects Simple History with no additional configuration required.
